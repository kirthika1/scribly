I just started a new project called Scribly âœ¨ðŸ“˜.
Scribly is a simple web application designed for readers like me who enjoy saving brief thoughts, quotations, and insights from the books we read. It was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ”¹ What Scribly Does:

enables users to save brief annotations or important details about any book.

provides a clear and uncluttered user interface for writing without interruptions.

Designed with usability and simplicity in mind

ðŸ’¡ Why I Made It: I frequently want to commit thought-provoking quotes or ideas from books to memory. My answer to that is Scribly, a digital notebook designed especially for books.

ðŸ›  What I Used: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
Just essential web technologies to strengthen my frontend abilitiesâ€”no frameworks.

I was able to learn more about DOM manipulation thanks to this project.
